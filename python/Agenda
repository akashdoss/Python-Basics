1. Introduction to Python
Objective: Explain what Python is, its uses, and why it's a good choice for beginners.
Content:
What is Python?
Python versions (Python 2 vs Python 3)
How Python is used (web development, data science, automation, etc.)
Installing Python (brief guide on installation)
Running Python code (IDLE, terminal, VS Code, etc.)


2. Python Syntax and Basics
Objective: Introduce Python syntax and basic commands.
Content:
Writing and running your first Python program (print("Hello, World!"))
Python syntax rules (indentation, comments, etc.)
Variables and types (numbers, strings, booleans)
Simple input and output functions (input() and print())


3. Data Types and Variables
Objective: Dive deeper into Python's built-in data types.
Content:
Understanding variables
Primitive data types:
Integer (int)
Floating-point (float)
String (str)
Boolean (bool)
Type casting (e.g., int() to float())
Common string operations (concatenation, slicing)


4. Operators in Python
Objective: Cover different types of operators used in Python.
Content:
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
Logical operators (and, or, not)
Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
Special operators: membership (in), identity (is)


5. Control Flow (if, elif, else)
Objective: Teach conditional statements.
Content:
if statement
elif and else
Nested conditions
Examples of real-world decision-making scenarios

7. Functions in Python
Objective: Explain functions and their importance.
Content:
Defining a function (def)
Function parameters and return values
*args and **kwargs
Scope of variables inside functions (local vs global)


8. Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
Objective: Introduce data structures used to store collections.
Content:
Lists: creating, accessing, and modifying
Tuples: immutable collections
Dictionaries: key-value pairs
Basic operations on these data structures (adding, deleting, searching)


9. Working with Files
Objective: Teach file handling (read, write, and append).
Content:
Opening and closing files
Reading from a file (read(), readlines())
Writing to a file (write(), writelines())
