1. What is Python?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is popular for tasks like web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and more.

2. Python Versions (Python 2 vs Python 3)
Python 2 and Python 3 are the two major versions of Python. Python 2, though widely used in the past, is deprecated, and Python 3 is now the standard. Python 3 introduced several improvements, including better syntax, more powerful libraries, and consistent Unicode handling. All modern projects use Python 3.

3. How Python is Used
Web development: Using frameworks like Django, Flask
Data Science: Using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
Automation: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks
Machine Learning: Using libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
Game Development: Using engines like Pygame


4. Installing Python
[Visit Python's Official Website](https://www.python.org/)to download the latest version of Python.
For Windows: Use the installer and ensure to check "Add Python to PATH".
For macOS: Install using Homebrew (brew install python).
For Linux: Install via package manager (sudo apt install python3).


5. Running Python Code
You can run Python code in multiple ways:
IDLE: The built-in Python IDE.
Terminal/Command Prompt: Use the python3 command.
VS Code: A popular text editor that supports Python via extensions.
Simple Python Program
Program 1: Print "Hello, World!"
python
print("Hello, World!")


Program 2: Add two numbers
python
a = 10
b = 20
sum = a + b
print(sum)

Program 3: Simple input and output
